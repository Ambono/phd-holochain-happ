## Steps

### 0. Build `holochain` and `dna-util`

You'll need two binaries to develop DNAs: the actual Holochain conductor binary, and the dna-util library which assists with assembling Wasms into a DNA file.

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/holochain/holochain && cd ./holochain`
- Ensure correct version of rust tool-chain and holochain install scripts via nix: `nix-shell` (this can be done by entering `nix-shell` at the root of the holochain directory.)
- Install the holochain and dna-util binaries: `hc-install`

You should now have `holochain` and `dna-util` on your PATH.

### 1. Write your Zomes

Each zome is a Rust crate. See [zomes/whoami](zomes/whoami) and [zomes/foo](zomes/foo) for examples.

### 2. Build your Zomes into Wasm

When you want to (re)build your zomes into Wasm, simply run

```bash
CARGO_TARGET=target cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

and they will be available in `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/`

### 3. Assemble your Wasms into a DNA file

*Note: Soon, this process will be easier in that it will not require a `.dna.workdir`*

1. Create a `demo.dna.workdir` directory (replace "demo" with whatever you want)
2. Create a `demo.dna.workdir/dna.json` file which references the `*.wasm` files you built in the previous step. See the [dna.json](dna.json) file in this repo for an example.
  - Note: this is a bit hacky right now. Normally when using a dna.workdir, you would include the Wasms alongside the `dna.json` in the same directory. However, it is easier for the purposes of this tutorial to let the `dna.json` reference Wasms in a different directory. The workdir construct becomes more useful when you need to go back and forth between an already-built DNA and its constituent Wasms.
3. Run the following command to assemble your Wasms into a DNA file per your dna.json:

```bash
dna-util -c demo.dna.workdir
```

This will produce a `demo.dna.gz` file as a sibling of the `demo.dna.workdir` directory.

### 4. Use the Conductor's admin interface to install your DNA

If you are using Tryorama to run tests against your DNA, you can jump over to the [tryorama README](https://github.com/holochain/tryorama-rsm) and follow the instructions there.

If you are running Holochain using your own setup, you'll have to have a deeper understanding of Holochain than is in scope for this tutorial. Roughly speaking, you'll need to:

- make sure `holochain` is running with a configuration that includes an admin interface websocket port
- send a properly encoded [`InstallApp`](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/66ca899d23842cadebc214d591475987f4af4f43/crates/holochain/src/conductor/api/api_external/admin_interface.rs#L240) command over the websocket
- be sure to `ActivateApp` and `AttachAppInterface` as well.
